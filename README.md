## Background
Different human organs have different functions, so there will be differences in the level of gene expression. Through bioinformatics analysis of tissues from different organs, functional differences between organs can be searched for at the molecular level.
## Methods
A total of 6 sets of RNA sequencing (RNAseq) sequencing data from liver and brain were understanded for sample relationship, difference analysis, functional enrichment analysis and construction of protein-protein interaction network.  
By performing differential expression gene (DEG) analysis, 4226 up-regulated and 5919 down-regulated DEGs were successfully identified, respectively. In the DEGs enrichment analysis results. Of the top five KEGG and top five GOBP biological concepts, four were related to metabolism, including metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, retinol metabolism, and small molecule catabolic process. Four are related to the regulation of synaptic function, including modulation of chemical synaptic transmission, regulation of trans-synaptic signaling, synapse organization, and regulation of synaptic plasticity. 
## Result
At the same time, one cluster with high scores was found through the interaction network. There are four high-degree DEGs in this sub-network, FGA, HRG, C8A, and GC. They probably are key genes in the process of liver coagulation.Analysis of genetic differences in different organs can help design in vitro human-relevant models for disease study and drug therapy.
